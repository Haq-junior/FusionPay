## Technical Debt Addressed

1. **Lack of testing** - Now has comprehensive test setup
2. **Poor error handling** - Enhanced with boundaries and validation
3. **Configuration scattered** - Centralized config management
4. **Security vulnerabilities** - Input sanitization and CSP
5. **Backend data persistence** - Stable storage implementation
6. **Code quality issues** - Linting and formatting tools

## Performance Improvements

1. **Frontend optimization** - Better state management
2. **Backend efficiency** - Optimized data structures
3. **Bundle size** - Proper code splitting preparation
4. **Caching strategy** - Config-based optimization

## Recommendations

1. **Continue with testing** - Expand coverage to 80%+
2. **Implement CI/CD** - Automate testing and deployment
3. **Add monitoring** - Track performance and errors
4. **User testing** - Gather feedback for UX improvements
5. **Security audit** - Professional security review

This comprehensive review has significantly improved the FusionPay project's foundation, security, and maintainability. The project is now ready for production-scale development with proper testing, validation, and error handling in place.
